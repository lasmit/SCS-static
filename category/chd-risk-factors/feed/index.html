				<description><![CDATA[<p>Long QT interval and high risk of CHD mortality A long QT interval in the resting ECG was associated with a 4-fold 15-year CHD mortality risk in middle-aged men and a 3-fold 5-year risk in the elderly men of Zutphen. These associations could not be attributed to prevalent heart disease and were independent of other &#91;...&#93;</p>
